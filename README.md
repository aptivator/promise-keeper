# promise-keeper

### Introduction

Promise Keeper is a minimalist (yet complete) implementation of JavaScript 
Promises.  Asynchronicity is at the core of JavaScript and use of promises is 
becoming a ubiquitous way to wrangle time-variant software operations.  This 
utility was written for demonstration and education purposes to provide just one
blueprint to understand Promises by looking at their implementation.  To make 
that inquiry process manageable, the code footprint was kept as small as 
possible while maintaining the necessary structure and clarity so as not to 
detract from comprehension.

This tool will work in a production environment.  Such usage, however, is 
discouraged.  Promise Keeper was written for the expressed purposes and no
effort has been made to optimize its code for the fullest perfromance.  Promises
are now standard in all modern browsers and latest node.js implementation.  A
developer is encouraged to rely on those.
