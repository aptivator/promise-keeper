# promise-keeper

### Introduction

Promise Keeper is a minimalist (yet complete) implementation of JavaScript 
Promises.  Asynchronicity is at the core of JavaScript and use of promises is 
becoming a ubiquitous way to wrangle time-variant software operations.  This 
utility was written for demonstration and education purposes and to provide just 
one blueprint to understand Promises by looking at their implementation.  To 
make that inquiry process manageable the code footprint was kept as small as 
possible (about 130 lines) while maintaining the necessary structure and clarity.

This tool will work in a production environment.  Such usage is discouraged.
Promise Keeper was written for the expressed objectives and no effort has been 
made to optimize its code for the fullest performance.  Promises support is now 
standard in all modern browsers and latest node.js versions.  A developer 
is encouraged to rely on those.
